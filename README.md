# 💫 Hi, My name is Mehak!
- 🤓 A PhD candidate in the Centre for Research Training in Genomics Data Science Programme at the University of Galway, Ireland. <br/>
- 🫀🧬 My research dives into genes, ageing, and aortic health, as I explore genetic variations and their impact on the cellular makeup of the aorta. <br/>

- ⚡ Random Fun facts: <br/>
  👉🏼 Did you know the aorta is the largest blood vessel in your body, about 2.5 cm wide, like a garden hose? But when an aneurysm forms, it can expand to the size of a grapefruit! 🤯 <br/><br/>
  👉🏼 You probably know that genomes are packed with information, but did you know that humans share about 60% of their DNA with bananas? So, while you’re working with RNA-seq, WES or any genetic data to decode complex human genetics, you're also a distant cousin to the banana! 🍌🔬 <br/><br/>
