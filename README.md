- ⚡ Random Fun facts:
  👉🏼 Did you know the aorta is the largest blood vessel in your body, about 2.5 cm wide, like a garden hose? But when an aneurysm forms, it can expand to the size of a grapefruit! 🤯 Can you imagine the pressure that would put on the body? It’s a reminder of how important it is to keep that "highway" healthy! 🛣️ <br/>
  👉🏼 You probably know that genomes are packed with information, but did you know that humans share about 60% of their DNA with bananas? So, while you’re working with RNA-seq and WES to decode complex human genetics, you're also a distant cousin to the banana! 🍌🔬 <br/>
- 📊 The stats below might not look that good now, but trust me! I am getting there :)
