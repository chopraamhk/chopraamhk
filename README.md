## Hi, My name is Mehak!

- 🤓 A PhD student in the Centre for Research Training in Genomics Data Science Programme at the University of Galway, Ireland. <br/>
- 🫀🧬 My work focuses on studying genetic variants and their impact on the cellular proportion of the aorta. <br/>

- ⚡ Fun fact: You probably know that genomes are packed with information, but did you know that humans share about 60% of their DNA with bananas? So, while you’re working with RNA-seq and WES to decode complex human genetics, you're also a distant cousin to the banana! 🍌🔬 <br/>

- The stats might not look that good at the moment, but I am getting there!
